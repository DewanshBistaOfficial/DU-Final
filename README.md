## Contents

### üìÅ `Data Gen.ipynb`
This notebook is responsible for generating and formatting synthetic market data, using APIs and randomization techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Generates synthetic or fetched financial data.
- Prepares the data for downstream analysis.
- Uses APIs such as Polygon and OpenAI for data enrichment.

**Main Libraries:**
- `pandas`
- `openai`
- `polygon`
- `datetime`
- `random`
- `os`

### üìÅ `Data Analysis.ipynb`
This notebook focuses on analyzing the generated data and applying machine learning techniques to predict market behavior.

**Main Tasks:**
- Data transformation for binary classification (e.g., price up or down).
- Feature correlation and collinearity analysis.
- Data visualization using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Model training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation using accuracy and classification reports.

**Main Libraries:**
- `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `sklearn` (for model training and evaluation)
- `statsmodels` (for collinearity diagnostics)
