# Data Science Project: Market Data Generation & Predictive Modeling

## Overview

This project presents a two-phase data science pipeline focused on synthetic feature generation and stock market movement prediction. By integrating language model prompting techniques and traditional machine learning workflows, the project explores a novel approach to financial data augmentation and classification modeling.

## Project Explanation

This project leverages ChatGPT for synthetic feature generation through prompt engineering. 

The algorithm begins iterating through a dataset created by combining various API Calls to the Polygon API holding various information about a stock.

On each phase of iteration the algorithm then selects from a wide variety of  prompt introduction prefixes for each prompt as well as changing the ‚Äútemperature‚Äù a preset parameter for the output of the model, this is useful for enhancing the quality and uniqueness of each feature.

The next step that the algorithm uses is to add an output line. This line helps structure the output of each prompt, making it more easily compatible with tabular datasets that it later needs to be refined into.

Finally the algorithm interjects a core prompt, which will dynamically read through the Polygon dataset and include both the target stock ticker and date of interest.

Finally the algorithm sends the prompt to the ChatGPT API for a response, and will repeat this process several times for each different ‚Äúcore prompt‚Äù in the array. 

After all the iterations are done the result are several synthetic features which can then used as input for machine learning models aimed at analyzing and forecasting stock price behavior.

## Issues and Further Discussion

When generating the data, similar prompts could lead to collinearity, this was solved by adjusting the temperature, as well as changing prompt introductions

Another challenge is dealing with ‚Äòhallucinations‚Äô since GPT has no verification mechanism for it‚Äôs answers, the trick was to not ask it factual questions but more qualitative ones

Since GPT does not answer questions in a standardized format, there were issues extracting the exact answers needed from the response text this was partially solved by adding in a formatting line

This project was limited to using GPT related data using different LLM systems, especially without content filters may have led to different results

Similarly the project only looked into tech stock, if looking at different security classes or stock types may have led to similarly different results

This project partially failed in objectives because the LLM data augmentation was used to replace what is normally complex human reccomendations, it seems that when using GPT generated data it may be better to stick to more simple questions
